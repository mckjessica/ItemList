This project serves as a straightforward tool for analyzing word frequencies and generating histograms from a provided text file. A notable strength lies in its modular design, where functions are thoughtfully organized to bolster readability and maintainability. However, one area requiring improvement is input handling, particularly in addressing edge cases and invalid inputs to enhance user-friendliness. The most challenging aspect encountered was effectively managing the switch case structure, necessitating careful navigation of user input validation, menu options, and function calls to ensure smooth program execution and mitigate unintended outcomes. The ability to decompose tasks into smaller, reusable functions demonstrated in this project holds significant transferable value across diverse programming scenarios. To uphold maintainability, readability, and adaptability, function names align with their respective functionalities, complemented by clear comments. Additionally, the program's menu-driven architecture facilitates seamless integration of new features or modifications, underscoring its versatility and long-term viability.
